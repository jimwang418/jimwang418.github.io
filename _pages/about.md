**Hi! I'm Jim!** I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zackory Erickson](https://zackory.com/). Prior to joining RI, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and M.S.E. in Robotics from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Peter Kazanzides](https://smarts.lcsr.jhu.edu/people/peter-kazanzides/), Prof. [Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/), and Prof. [Iulian Iordachita](https://amiro.lcsr.jhu.edu/iulianiordachita/).

I am broadly interested in human-robot interaction. Specifically, my work focuses on natural-language communication between humans and agents, as well as physical interactions between humans and robots.

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy running, tennis, skiing, and photography. -->
